    <h3 class="mt-4">3. How We Protect Your Data</h3>
    <p>
        We implement reasonable technical measures to ensure your expense data is safe.
        However, no system is 100% secure, and you acknowledge that you use the system at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">4. Sharing of Information</h3>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share your personal or expense data with outside parties.

    </p>

    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">6. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
        If the application uses external libraries (e.g., Chart.js), those tools may collect anonymous usage data.
